# Project Plan: ExpensesHub PWA Implementation

**Created:** 2025-10-03  
**Status:** Active  
**Owner:** Samuel Fernandez

## Overview

This plan outlines the complete implementation strategy for ExpensesHub, a mobile-first Progressive Web Application for personal expense and income tracking. The application will be built using Nuxt 3, PrimeVue (Aura preset), TypeScript, and MongoDB, with comprehensive E2E testing using Playwright exclusively. The implementation follows an 8-phase approach spanning 6 weeks, with emphasis on constitutional compliance, code quality, and user experience excellence.

## Objectives

- Deliver a production-ready PWA meeting all constitutional principles (code quality, testing, UX, performance)
- Implement all functional requirements from the specification (Landing, Charts, Settings pages)
- Achieve WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance across all interfaces
- Meet Core Web Vitals targets (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1)
- Establish comprehensive Playwright E2E test coverage for all critical user paths
- Deploy installable PWA with offline capabilities

## Constitution Compliance Check

Before proceeding, verify alignment with constitutional principles:

- [x] **Code Quality Excellence:** Plan includes TypeScript strict mode, ESLint/Prettier setup, JSDoc documentation requirements, code review process, and < 50 line function targets
- [x] **Testing Standards (Playwright):** E2E test coverage planned for all user-facing features with Page Object Model pattern, cross-browser testing, and CI integration
- [x] **Vue-tsc Standards:** No Ts errors should be present at any time. Before consider a task as complete search a fix any ts error
- [x] **User Experience Consistency:** PrimeVue Aura design system adherence, responsive breakpoints (320px-1440px+), WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility, loading states, and consistent interactions
- [x] **Performance Requirements:** Bundle size limits (< 200KB gzipped), Core Web Vitals targets, MongoDB query optimization, code splitting, and performance monitoring

## Technical Context

### Technology Stack

**Frontend:**

- **Framework:** Nuxt 3 (Vue 3 with SSR/SSG support)
- **UI Library:** PrimeVue with Aura preset
- **Styling:** PrimeVue theme system + custom CSS
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Charts:** vue-chartjs (Chart.js wrapper for Vue 3)
- **State Management:** Nuxt built-in state (useState, Pinia if needed)
- **HTTP Client:** Nuxt $fetch (built-in)

**Backend:**

- **Database:** MongoDB (cloud-hosted, e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
- **API:** Nuxt Server API routes (/server/api/)
- **ORM:** Mongoose for MongoDB schemas and models
- **Validation:** Zod for runtime type validation

**Testing:**

- **E2E Testing:** Playwright (exclusively, no unit/integration tests)
- **Test Pattern:** Page Object Model
- **Browsers:** Chromium, Firefox, WebKit

**DevOps:**

- **Build Tool:** Vite (built into Nuxt 3)
- **Linting:** ESLint with TypeScript and Vue rules
- **Formatting:** Prettier
- **Git Hooks:** Husky or simple-git-hooks
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (recommended)
- **Hosting:** Vercel or Netlify for edge deployment

**PWA:**

- **Service Worker:** @vite-pwa/nuxt module
- **Manifest:** Auto-generated with @vite-pwa/nuxt
- **Caching:** Workbox strategies

### Architecture Decisions

**Why Nuxt 3 instead of plain Vue 3?**

- Built-in SSR/SSG for better initial load performance
- File-based routing reduces boilerplate
- Auto-imports for components and composables
- Server API routes for MongoDB integration
- Built-in PWA support via modules
- Better SEO (though less critical for PWA)

**Why MongoDB instead of IndexedDB?**

- Centralized data storage enables future multi-device sync
- Better query capabilities for complex filtering
- Easier to implement backup/restore features
- Scales better for future enhancements (shared expenses, etc.)
- Server-side data processing for charts and reports

**Data Architecture:**

- Client-side: Nuxt state + localStorage for user preferences
- Server-side: MongoDB for transactions and categories
- Sync: Real-time updates via API calls
- Offline: Service worker cache + queue for offline actions

**API Design:**

- RESTful Nuxt server routes in /server/api/
- CRUD endpoints for transactions and categories
- Aggregation endpoints for chart data
- Settings endpoints for user preferences

| Playwright tests become flaky            | High   | Medium      | Follow Page Object Model strictly, use proper waits, avoid time-based delays, implement retry logic   |
| Mobile performance below targets         | High   | Low         | Profile early, optimize MongoDB queries, implement virtualization for lists, minimize re-renders      |
| Accessibility compliance gaps            | Medium | Medium      | Use PrimeVue accessible components, run automated a11y tests, manual keyboard testing, screen readers |
| TypeScript strict mode adoption friction | Low    | High        | Start strict from day 1, use proper types, create reusable type definitions, educate team             |
| Offline sync conflicts                   | Medium | Low         | Implement last-write-wins strategy, show conflict warnings, add timestamp-based resolution            |
| MongoDB schema changes breaking data     | High   | Low         | Version schemas, implement migrations, backup data before changes, test with production-like data     |
| Cross-browser compatibility issues       | Medium | Medium      | Run Playwright on all 3 browsers regularly, test on real devices, use autoprefixer for CSS            |

## Notes

**Mobile-First Approach:**
The entire application is designed with mobile as the primary target (375x812px base design). All components must work perfectly on mobile before adapting to larger screens. Test on real mobile devices regularly, not just browser DevTools.

**Playwright-Only Testing:**
Per constitutional requirements and user specification, we are using Playwright for E2E testing exclusively. No unit tests or integration tests. This means E2E tests must be comprehensive, covering all user flows, edge cases, and error states.

**MongoDB Considerations:**

- Use MongoDB Atlas free tier for development
- Design schema with indexes for performance
- Implement connection pooling
- Use aggregation pipelines for chart data
- Consider document size limits (16MB max)
- Plan for potential migration to multi-user model

**PWA Best Practices:**

- Cache static assets aggressively
- Implement stale-while-revalidate for API data
- Provide clear offline indicators
- Queue offline actions for sync
- Test installation on multiple devices
- Optimize for home screen icon

**Performance Budget:**

- Initial bundle: < 200KB gzipped
- Largest image: < 100KB
- Total page weight: < 1MB
- Time to Interactive: < 3s on 3G
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s

**Accessibility Checklist:**

- Color contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 for normal text
- Color contrast ratio ≥ 3:1 for large text
- All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- Focus indicators visible
- Skip links implemented
- ARIA labels for icon-only buttons
- Screen reader testing with NVDA/JAWS

**Code Quality Enforcement:**

- Pre-commit hooks run ESLint + Prettier
- PR template includes constitutional checklist
- No merging with failing tests
- Code review required for all changes
- TypeScript strict mode from day 1
- Function size limit: 50 lines (enforced by ESLint)

**Future Considerations (Not in Scope):**

- Multi-user support
- Authentication/authorization
- Cloud backup/sync across devices
- Budget limits and alerts
- Recurring transactions
- Bank account integration
- Receipt photo attachments
- Advanced analytics
