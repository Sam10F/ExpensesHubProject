# ExpensesHub Project Constitution

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Ratification Date:** 2025-10-03  
**Last Amended:** 2025-10-03

## Purpose

This constitution establishes the foundational principles and standards that govern all development activities within the ExpensesHub Project. These principles are non-negotiable and must be upheld in all code contributions, architectural decisions, and project evolution.

## Core Principles

### Principle 1: Code Quality Excellence

**Declaration:**  
All code MUST adhere to the highest standards of quality, maintainability, and clarity. Code is read far more often than it is written; therefore, readability and maintainability take precedence over clever optimizations.

**Requirements:**

- **Type Safety:** All code MUST use strict TypeScript configurations with no implicit `any` types. Type definitions MUST be comprehensive and accurate.
- **Code Organization:** Code MUST follow Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). Functions MUST be small, focused, and do one thing well (ideally < 50 lines).
- **Naming Conventions:** Variables, functions, classes, and files MUST have descriptive, self-documenting names that clearly communicate intent.
- **Documentation:** Public APIs, complex algorithms, and business logic MUST include JSDoc comments explaining purpose, parameters, return values, and edge cases.
- **Error Handling:** All error scenarios MUST be explicitly handled. No silent failures. Errors MUST include context for debugging.
- **Code Reviews:** All code MUST be peer-reviewed before merging. Reviews MUST verify adherence to these quality standards.
- **Linting & Formatting:** Code MUST pass all linter checks (ESLint) and be formatted consistently (Prettier). No exceptions.
- **Technical Debt:** When technical debt is introduced (with justification), it MUST be documented with TODO/FIXME comments and tracked in issues.

**Rationale:**  
High code quality reduces bugs, accelerates onboarding, simplifies maintenance, and ensures the codebase remains sustainable as the project grows. Quality is not optional—it is the foundation of professional software development.

### Principle 2: Testing Standards with Playwright

**Declaration:**  
All user-facing functionality MUST be covered by end-to-end tests written exclusively with Playwright. Testing is not an afterthought—it is integral to development.

**Requirements:**

- **Testing Framework:** Playwright MUST be the sole framework for all E2E testing. No other testing frameworks for E2E tests.
- **Test Coverage:** All critical user paths and workflows MUST have automated E2E tests before features are considered complete.
- **Test Quality:** Tests MUST be:
  - **Reliable:** No flaky tests. Tests MUST pass consistently or be fixed immediately.
  - **Isolated:** Each test MUST be independent and not rely on the state from other tests.
  - **Fast:** Tests MUST be optimized for speed while maintaining reliability.
  - **Readable:** Test names and structure MUST clearly communicate what is being tested and why.
- **Test Organization:** Tests MUST be organized by feature/module and follow the Page Object Model pattern for maintainability.
- **CI Integration:** All tests MUST run in continuous integration. No code can be merged if tests fail.
- **Test Maintenance:** Tests MUST be updated whenever the corresponding features change. Broken tests MUST be fixed within one sprint.
- **Browser Coverage:** Tests MUST run on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit (Playwright defaults) to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
- **Accessibility Testing:** E2E tests SHOULD include basic accessibility checks using Playwright's accessibility tools.

**Rationale:**  
Playwright provides comprehensive, reliable, cross-browser testing capabilities. Standardizing on a single E2E framework reduces complexity, improves maintainability, and ensures consistent testing practices. Automated E2E tests catch regressions early, provide confidence in deployments, and serve as living documentation of system behavior.

### Principle 3: User Experience Consistency

**Declaration:**  
The user experience MUST be consistent, intuitive, and delightful across all features and platforms. User experience is not subjective—it follows established design principles and usability standards.

**Requirements:**

- **Design System:** All UI components MUST adhere to a unified design system with consistent:
  - Typography (font families, sizes, weights, line heights)
  - Color palette (primary, secondary, semantic colors with WCAG AA compliance)
  - Spacing scale (consistent margins, padding, gaps)
  - Component patterns (buttons, forms, cards, modals, etc.)
- **Responsive Design:** All interfaces MUST be fully responsive and functional on mobile (320px+), tablet (768px+), and desktop (1024px+) viewports.
- **Accessibility:** All interfaces MUST meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards:
  - Keyboard navigation MUST work for all interactive elements
  - ARIA labels MUST be present where needed
  - Color contrast MUST meet minimum ratios
  - Screen readers MUST be able to navigate effectively
- **Performance Perception:** UI MUST feel fast:
  - Loading states MUST be shown for operations > 200ms
  - Optimistic updates MUST be used where appropriate
  - Skeleton screens or spinners MUST indicate progress
- **Error Communication:** Error messages MUST be user-friendly, actionable, and never expose technical details to end users.
- **Interaction Feedback:** All user actions MUST provide immediate visual feedback (button states, form validation, success/error messages).
- **Consistency:** Interactions MUST behave consistently (e.g., modals close with same gesture, forms validate with same patterns).

**Rationale:**  
Consistent UX reduces cognitive load, increases user confidence, and creates a professional product feel. Users should never feel lost, confused, or frustrated. Accessibility is not optional—it ensures the product is usable by everyone. A polished, consistent experience differentiates quality products from mediocre ones.

### Principle 4: Performance Requirements

**Declaration:**  
Performance is a feature, not an optimization. The application MUST be fast, efficient, and scalable. Performance degradation is considered a critical bug.

**Requirements:**

- **Core Web Vitals:** All pages MUST meet these thresholds:
  - **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** < 2.5 seconds
  - **First Input Delay (FID):** < 100 milliseconds
  - **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** < 0.1
- **Bundle Size:** JavaScript bundle size MUST be monitored and optimized:
  - Initial page load MUST be < 200KB (gzipped)
  - Code splitting MUST be used for routes and heavy features
  - Tree-shaking MUST eliminate unused code
  - Dependencies MUST be audited regularly for size and necessity
- **API Performance:** Backend API responses MUST meet these criteria:
  - P95 response time < 500ms for read operations
  - P95 response time < 1000ms for write operations
  - Database queries MUST be indexed and optimized
  - N+1 queries MUST be eliminated
- **Rendering Performance:** UI rendering MUST be optimized:
  - React re-renders MUST be minimized (use memoization, proper key props)
  - Large lists MUST use virtualization
  - Images MUST be lazy-loaded and properly sized
  - Fonts MUST be optimized (subset, preload, swap strategy)
- **Caching Strategy:** Aggressive caching MUST be implemented:
  - Static assets MUST have long cache lifetimes
  - API responses MUST be cached where appropriate
  - Service workers SHOULD be used for offline capability
- **Monitoring:** Performance MUST be continuously monitored:
  - Real User Monitoring (RUM) data MUST be collected
  - Performance budgets MUST be set and enforced in CI
  - Performance regressions MUST be caught before production

**Rationale:**  
Performance directly impacts user satisfaction, conversion rates, SEO rankings, and operational costs. Slow applications frustrate users and lose business. Performance must be designed in from the start—it cannot be bolted on later. Continuous monitoring ensures the product remains fast as it evolves.

## Governance

### Amendment Process

1. **Proposal:** Any team member may propose an amendment via a documented proposal including rationale and impact analysis.
2. **Review:** Proposals MUST be reviewed by all core team members within 2 weeks.
3. **Approval:** Amendments require unanimous approval from core team members.
4. **Documentation:** Approved amendments MUST update this constitution, increment the version appropriately, and update the Sync Impact Report.
5. **Propagation:** All dependent templates, documentation, and processes MUST be updated to reflect amendments.

### Versioning Policy

- **MAJOR (X.0.0):** Breaking changes to principles, removal of principles, fundamental governance changes
- **MINOR (0.X.0):** New principles added, significant expansions to existing principles
- **PATCH (0.0.X):** Clarifications, wording improvements, typo fixes, non-semantic changes

### Compliance and Review

- **Code Reviews:** All pull requests MUST verify compliance with constitutional principles.
- **Quarterly Audits:** Every quarter, the team MUST audit the codebase for constitutional compliance and address violations.
- **Living Document:** This constitution MUST be reviewed annually and updated as the project evolves.
- **Enforcement:** Non-compliance is not acceptable. Violations MUST be addressed immediately through refactoring or documented technical debt with remediation plans.

## Signature

This constitution represents the collective commitment of the ExpensesHub Project team to excellence in software development. By contributing to this project, all team members acknowledge and agree to uphold these principles.
